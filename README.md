# Coding Dojo

### Motivation
- Create different ideas how to implement our data model
- This makes it easier to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches
- We will hopefully create a vision where we want to go
- We will hopefully agree on one approach
- We will hopefully learn from the different approaches

### Today's focus
- I suggest we focus today on an 'immutable' model
- Why? Because it seems to be the preferred solution for most of you right now
- You don't agree? So create another way to solve the task

### Follow ups
- we should create more approaches in the near future to compare them

### Existing code
- An interface 'rest-service' with the single method 'addAclEntry'
- A 'data-access-service' with the methods 'get' and 'update'
- The tests in 'test-rest-call'

### Your job
- Implement the logic that is required by the 'rest-service' 
- Make sure that the tests work
- Put focus especially on the implementation of the model
